# Project Plan: Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

---

## 1. Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive time series analysis of the provided datasets. We aim to identify underlying patterns such as trends, seasonality, and cycles. Based on this analysis, we will develop a forecasting model to predict future values and select the best-performing model based on robust evaluation metrics.

## 2. Dataset

The analysis will be performed on the "Time Series Practice Dataset," which contains synthetic data designed for practicing time series skills. 

*   **Source:** [Kaggle: Time Series Practice Dataset](http://kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/time-series-practice-dataset)
*   **Content:** The dataset includes multiple time series, such as daily minimum temperatures, monthly air temperatures, and shampoo sales. This project will analyze each series to understand its unique characteristics.

## 3. Project Structure and Tooling

This project will adhere to a standardized and reproducible structure, facilitated by the Cookiecutter Data Science template. This ensures a logical organization of code, data, and documentation. 

*   **`notebooks/`**: This directory will contain all Jupyter notebooks used for initial exploration, visualization, and iterative model development. The thought process and experimental steps will be documented here.
*   **`src/`**: This directory will house the finalized Python scripts (`.py` files). These scripts will be modular and organized, ready for execution to preprocess data and run the modeling pipeline.
*   **`data/`**: Will be split into `01_raw`, `02_intermediate`, and `03_processed` to manage data in different stages of the pipeline.
*   **`models/`**: The final, serialized (saved) versions of the trained models will be stored here.

## 4. Project Phases

### Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The goal of this phase is to deeply understand the characteristics of each time series in the dataset.

*   **Visual Analysis:**
    *   **Time Series Plots:** To visualize the data over time and identify obvious trends, cycles, or shifts.
    *   **Decomposition Plots:** To break down each series into its constituent parts: Trend, Seasonality, and Residuals.
    *   **ACF and PACF Plots:** To identify potential lag dependencies and inform parameter selection for ARIMA-family models.
    *   **Box Plots & Seasonal Plots:** To visualize distributions and confirm seasonal patterns (e.g., by month, quarter, or day of the week).
*   **Statistical Analysis:**
    *   **Summary Statistics:** To understand the basic statistical properties of each series (mean, median, standard deviation).
    *   **Stationarity Tests:** An Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test will be performed on each series to formally check for stationarity. Non-stationary series will be flagged for transformation in the next phase.
    *   **Outlier and Missing Value Identification:** Systematically check for and document any missing data points or significant outliers that may require special handling.

### Phase 2: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

This phase focuses on preparing the data for the modeling stage based on the insights from the EDA.

*   **Handling Missing Values:** Depending on the nature and amount of missing data, methods such as forward-fill, backward-fill, linear interpolation, or seasonal interpolation will be applied.
*   **Transformations:**
    *   **Stationarity:** For non-stationary series, apply differencing (regular or seasonal) to stabilize the mean.
    *   **Variance Stabilization:** Apply transformations like the logarithm or Box-Cox to stabilize variance if heteroscedasticity is observed.
*   **Train/Test Split:** The data will be split into a training set and a hold-out test set using a time-based approach (e.g., using the last 12-24 months as the test set) to ensure the model is evaluated on unseen future data.

### Phase 3: Model Development

A range of models will be developed, starting with a simple baseline and progressively increasing in complexity.

*   **Baseline Models:**
    *   Naive Forecast (e.g., last value, seasonal naive).
    *   Simple Moving Average / Seasonal Average.
*   **Statistical Models:**
    *   **Exponential Smoothing (ETS):** A suitable variant (e.g., Holt-Winters) will be chosen based on the presence of trend and seasonality.
    *   **ARIMA/SARIMA:** Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models will be fitted, with parameters (p,d,q)(P,D,Q) guided by the ACF/PACF plots from the EDA.
*   **Machine Learning Models (Optional Extension):**
    *   **Prophet:** Facebook's Prophet model, which works well with strong seasonality and holidays.
    *   **LightGBM/XGBoost:** Tree-based models can be used if additional features are engineered (e.g., lag features, date-based features).

### Phase 4: Model Evaluation

Models will be rigorously evaluated to select the best performer for forecasting.

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   **Scale-Dependent Errors:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
    *   **Percentage Errors:** Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), a recommended metric for this dataset. [6]
*   **Validation Strategy:**
    *   **Hold-out Validation:** Initial evaluation will be performed on the test set created in Phase 2.
    *   **Cross-Validation (Optional):** For a more robust evaluation, time series cross-validation (e.g., walk-forward validation) can be implemented.

### Phase 5: Deployment and Next Steps

The final phase involves operationalizing the best model and considering future improvements.

*   **Model Serialization:** The best-performing model, along with its entire preprocessing pipeline, will be saved to a file (e.g., using `pickle` or `joblib`) and stored in the `models/` directory.
*   **Dashboard Development:** A simple interactive dashboard will be created to visualize the historical data, the model's forecasts, and key performance metrics.
    *   **Potential Tools:** Streamlit, Plotly Dash.
    *   **Features:** The dashboard will allow users to view the forecast, zoom into specific time periods, and see the model's accuracy.
